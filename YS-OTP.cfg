// For n>10, content within line n-10 generates file(n-10).in as the input file (or Plaintext), and

Bodhi originally has no tree. The bright mirror also has no stand. Fundamentally there is not a single thing. Where could dust arise?
Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace.
Where there is hatred let me sow love,
Where there is injury let me sow pardon,
Where there is doubt let me sow faith,
Where there is despair let me give hope,
Where there is darkness let me give light,
Where there is sadness let me give joy.
O Divine Master, grant that
I may not try to be comforted but to comfort,
Not try to be understood but to understand,
Not try to be loved but to love.
Because it is in giving that we receive,
It is in forgiving that we are forgiven,
And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' (Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 5 by William Shakespeare)
'No man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the continent, A part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less. As well as if a promontory were. As well as if a manor of thy friend's Or of thine own were: Any man's death diminishes me, Because I am involved in mankind, And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.' (No Man Is an Island by John Donne)
'Death, be not proud, though some have called thee. Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so; For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow, Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me. From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be, Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow, And soonest our best men with thee do go, Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery. Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell, And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well, And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then? One short sleep past, we wake eternally. And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.' ('Holy Sonnet 10: Death, Be Not Proud' by John Donne 1572-1631)
'Toss The Starfish! There is an old story that tells of a man walking along a beach who catches sight of another man acting strangely. As he gets closer, he notices that the man is picking things up from the sand and throwing them into the water. Upon reaching him, he sees the objects being tossed are starfish, stranded on shore by the retreating tide. Curious about his intentions, the first man asked, 'What are you doing?' 'I am saving these starfish,' he replied. 'They won't survive in the sun until the tide returns.' Totally taken aback by this statement, the first man said, rather indignantly, 'Aren't you being a little silly? Do you not realize how many hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of starfish there are in the sea and that by throwing a few back will make absolutely no difference?' The second man said nothing but was unfazed. He picked up yet another starfish and threw it out into the waves. Then he looked back the first man and said, 'Well, it made a difference to that one.' In a world where we witness injustice, misfortune and hatred almost on a daily basis, it's easy for us to see our lot in life from a jaded point of view. We learn to accept the notion that we, as individuals, have no real control and that in the bigger scheme of things, what we do doesn't really matter. As a result, we tend to retreat emotionally and psychologically, so as not to deal with the things we believe are out of our hands. But when we do try to make a difference, no matter how small, two things happen. Firstly, we feel good about ourselves. Being a positive force in this world helps us find meaning and focus. Why does it feel so good making others happy? I'm not sure, but somewhere in that question may lie the key to understanding why we're here. The second thing that happens is contagion. When we demonstrate our faith and will to make a difference, no matter how small, we turn on something in others. In them, a tiny light is sparked. They may be inspired to do the same. And if enough people catch this fire, we can truly change the world. So, to the nurse who may be feeling that saying a kind word won't make a patient's day, to the man on the street who may be thinking 'a donation of a few cents can't help much', and to the teacher who may be disheartened by the fact that a lot of extra time and effort will be required to simply help a few more weak students pass one paper, take heart. Your work is appreciated, and what you're doing will help motivate others do the same. You are making a difference.' (A Slice of Life - Produced and presented by Eugene Loh)
Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him, as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his 'meaningless' life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: 'Why was I here?' (The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom)
